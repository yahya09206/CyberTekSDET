Primitive Castings: Converting one primitive type to another
	double --> float --> long --> int --> short --> byte
	larger primitive type cannot be directly assigned to smaller type
	2 types:
		Implicit casting: Automatically done whenever you are trying to assign a smaller primitive to a larger primitive type
			double a = 3
				a ==> 3.0

		Explicit casting: Casting the larger type to the smaller
			double a = 3;
			int b =  (int)a;
