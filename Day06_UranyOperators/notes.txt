Primitive Castings: Converting one primitive type to another
	double --> float --> long --> int --> short --> byte
	larger primitive type cannot be directly assigned to smaller type
	2 types:
		Implicit casting: Automatically done whenever you are trying to assign a smaller primitive to a larger primitive type
			double a = 3
				a ==> 3.0

		Explicit casting: Casting the larger type to the smaller
			double a = 3;
			int b =  (int)a;

Unary Operator:
	+	Unary Plus Operator		Indicates positive value
	-  	Unary Minus 			Negates an expression or value
	++	Increment Operator		Increments a value by 1
	--	Decrement Operator		Decremenets a value by 1

Difference between pre and post
	When the operator is placed before an operand (++expr, --expr), the variable will be incremented or decremented by 1 in the memory, and the new value is used in the expression in which it appears.

	When the operator is placed after an operand(expr++,expr--), the old value of the variable will be used in the expression where it appears and then the variable will be incremented or decremented by 1 in the memory.
