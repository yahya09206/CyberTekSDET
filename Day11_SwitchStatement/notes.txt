Switch Statement:
	Switch-case statement is used to compare the value of a variable with multiple values and execute some statements based on the match

	No curly brackets for case blocks, even in case of more than 1 statements

	All the case block statements are optional including break
	Blank case is perfectly legal code

	Default block can appear anywhere in the code. It should not be the last one

	'switch', 'case', 'default', 'break'

	Syntax:
		switch(Data){
			case 1: 
				data1;
				break;
			case 2: 
				data2
				break;
			case 3: 
				data3;
				break;
		}
